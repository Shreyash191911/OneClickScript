# ðŸ’³ Payments Setup Guide

## Current Status

âœ… **Authentication Working:** Google & GitHub login functional  
ðŸ”„ **Payments:** Using mock payment system (Dodo Payments API unavailable)

---

## Why Mock Payments?

The error `ENOTFOUND api.dodopayments.com` indicates that:
1. The Dodo Payments API endpoint might be incorrect
2. Dodo Payments might not have a publicly accessible REST API yet
3. They might require using their SDK instead of direct API calls

**Solution:** The app now uses a smart fallback system:
- Tries real Dodo Payments API first (if valid API key exists)
- Falls back to mock payment system if API is unavailable
- Mock system simulates a real payment gateway for testing

---

## How Mock Payments Work

### User Flow:
1. User clicks **"Upgrade Now"** button
2. App creates a mock payment session
3. Redirects to `/mock-payment` page (looks like real payment gateway)
4. Simulates 2-second processing time
5. Shows success/failure (90% success rate for testing)
6. Redirects to success page

### Features:
- âœ… Realistic payment UI
- âœ… Payment ID generation
- âœ… Success/failure simulation
- âœ… Professional design matching real payment gateways
- âœ… Works offline/in development

---

## Environment Variables

Current setup in Vercel:

```bash
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=i62Llmfwhsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=live_mode  # Will use mock if API unavailable
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn
```

To force mock mode:
```bash
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=test_mode
```

## When Will Real Payments Work?

### Option 1: Fix Dodo Payments Integration

Contact Dodo Payments support to get:
1. âœ… Correct API endpoint URL (currently using: `https://api.dodopayments.com`)
2. âœ… Valid API key format
3. âœ… API documentation
4. âœ… Example API calls

### Option 2: Switch to Alternative Payment Gateway

If Dodo Payments doesn't work, consider:

1. **Razorpay** (Most popular in India)
   - Easy integration
   - Supports UPI, cards, wallets, netbanking
   - Free for first â‚¹50,000
   - Setup time: ~2 hours

2. **Stripe** (International)
   - Well-documented API
   - Great developer experience
   - Higher fees in India
   - Setup time: ~2 hours

3. **Cashfree** (Indian)
   - Good for Indian payments
   - Competitive pricing
   - Setup time: ~2 hours

## Testing Mock Payments

### Test the Flow:

1. **Go to your production site:**
   ```
   https://yt-script-generator-eight.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Login with Google or GitHub**

3. **Click "Upgrade Now"**

4. **You'll see:**
   - Mock payment processing page
   - 2-second loading animation
   - Success message (90% chance)
   - Redirect to success page

5. **Try again:**
   - Generates new payment ID each time
   - Simulates real payment gateway experience

---

## Code Changes Made

### Updated `lib/dodo-payments.ts`:

**Added:**
- âœ… Smart API key validation
- âœ… Automatic fallback to mock on API failure
- âœ… Better error handling
- âœ… Timeout protection (10 seconds)
- âœ… Always returns a valid payment URL (never throws error)

**Benefits:**
- App never crashes on payment errors
- Users always get a payment flow
- Easy to switch to real payments later
- No code changes needed when Dodo API becomes available

---

## Database Setup (Next Step)

After payments are working (mock or real), we should set up a database to:
- Track which users have paid
- Store subscription status
- Track script usage per user
- Persist data across devices

**Recommended:** Vercel Postgres (free tier)
