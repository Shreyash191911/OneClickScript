# üÜò Dodo Payments API Issue - Help Needed

## Problem
The Dodo Payments REST API endpoint `api.dodopayments.com` cannot be resolved (DNS error).

## What We've Tried
1. ‚úÖ `https://api.dodopayments.com/v1/checkout/sessions`
2. ‚úÖ `https://app.dodopayments.com/api/v1/checkout/sessions`
3. ‚úÖ `https://dodopayments.com/api/v1/checkout/sessions`

All endpoints return: `ENOTFOUND` - domain doesn't exist

## What's Working
- ‚úÖ Your webhook URL is configured: `https://yt-script-generator-h5qxk44n7-shreyashs-projects-a0a83870.vercel.app/api/webhooks/dodo`
- ‚úÖ You have a valid API key: `i62Llmfwhsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn`
- ‚úÖ Webhook signing secret: `whsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn`
- ‚úÖ Live mode is enabled in your dashboard

## Request to Dodo Payments Support

Dear Dodo Payments Support,

I'm trying to integrate your payment gateway into my Next.js application but I'm getting a DNS resolution error for `api.dodopayments.com`.

**My Integration Details:**
- API Key: `i62Llmfwhsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn` (Live mode)
- Webhook: Successfully configured at app.dodopayments.com
- Error: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.dodopayments.com`

**Questions:**
1. What is the correct base URL for your REST API?
2. Do you have official documentation for creating checkout sessions via REST API?
3. Should I use your SDK instead of direct API calls?
4. Are there any IP whitelist requirements?

**My API Call:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dodopayments.com/v1/checkout/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer i62Llmfwhsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 299,
    "currency": "USD",
    "description": "OneClick Script Writer - Unlimited Plan",
    "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
    "success_url": "https://myapp.com/success",
    "cancel_url": "https://myapp.com/cancel"
  }'
```

Please provide the correct API endpoint and any documentation.

Thank you!
