# üÜò Contact Dodo Payments Support - Urgent API Help Needed

## Issue Summary

We're trying to integrate Dodo Payments but getting **404 Not Found** errors on all API endpoints.

## What We've Tried

According to your documentation at https://docs.dodopayments.com/api-reference/introduction:
- Base URL: `https://live.dodopayments.com` ‚úÖ (This works!)
- Base URL: `https://test.dodopayments.com` ‚úÖ (For testing)

But ALL these endpoints return **404**:
- ‚ùå `POST /v1/checkout-sessions`
- ‚ùå `POST /v1/payments`
- ‚ùå `POST /checkout-sessions`
- ‚ùå `POST /payments`

## Our Setup

**API Key**: `i62Llmfwhsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn` (Live mode)
**Webhook**: Already configured and working
**Authorization**: `Bearer {API_KEY}` format

## Request Details

```bash
curl -X POST https://live.dodopayments.com/v1/checkout-sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer i62Llmfwhsec_ub8BICyZbN5PmcEgcXV3nTpax1xPT4Wn" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 299,
    "currency": "USD",
    "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
    "success_url": "https://myapp.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
    "cancel_url": "https://myapp.com/cancel"
  }'
```

**Response**: `404 Not Found`

## Questions for Support

1. **What is the EXACT endpoint path for creating checkout sessions?**
   - Is it `/v1/checkout-sessions`, `/v1/payments`, or something else?

2. **Are there any additional headers required?**
   - We're using: Authorization, Content-Type, Accept

3. **Do we need to create a "Product" first in the dashboard?**
   - Or can we create one-time payments directly?

4. **Is there a Postman collection or example curl command that works?**

5. **Should we use your TypeScript SDK instead of direct API calls?**

## What We Need

**URGENT**: The exact, working API endpoint path for creating payment checkout sessions.

Our production app is ready to go live - we just need the correct API endpoint!

## Temporary Workaround

In the meantime, we've implemented:
1. Code that tries multiple endpoint variations
2. Detailed logging of all attempts and responses
3. The app will work as soon as the correct endpoint is found

## Thank You!

We love Dodo Payments and want to use your service. Please help us get unstuck so we can start processing payments!
